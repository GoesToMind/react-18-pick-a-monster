# Getting Started with Pick a Monster App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first refreshing project about React 18.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
